# benchmask
Simple Setup to Benchmark Facemasks



## Goal

- Mostly relative Benchmark masks in terms of filtration efficiency and differential pressure
- Sealing to dummy head is tested as well
- Affordable setup, bill of material of ca. 200USD

Fineprint, what it is not

- Replacement for lab testing, mainly since measuring particulate matter is hard, lab devices cost 15k and still have limitations. 
- No policitcal, medical claims
